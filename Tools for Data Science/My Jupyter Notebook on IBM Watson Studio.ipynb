    "*I am interested in Data Science, because I have studied mathematics for 6 years and I am a very social person. I think that Data Science is the perfect combination of these two skills, problem-solving, tools and analysis in Data Science is based on mathematics; at the same time you need to have good storytelling skills to communicate your findings. Additionally, you can apply Data Science in almost any field, meaning that with each new assignment, there are new things to explore and discover. And I very much like that.*"
